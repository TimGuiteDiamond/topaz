Topaz

Topaz is a package that converts .phs data files for electron density into
.maps. This is written as a prerequesite data proccessing step to the package
Eclip, documentation for which can be found here. ADD LINK HERE

This package calls functions from within CCP4 using CCP4Dispatchers. The outputs
of this are a set of .mtz files, and a set of .map files of various dimensions
and a set of .map files that are all the same specified dimensions. 

The github repositary for this package can be found `here

===================
Details on individual functions and their arguments can be found here:

Running
--------
Running is the module that pulls together the functions in topaz to convert the
.phs files into .map files. It then tessalates these map files using the best
symmetry of the crystal to form a map of predefined dimensions. While converting from .phs to .map, it also creates .mtz files. 

This can be run by calling RunTopaz from the command line. More information about the arguments of RunTopaz can be found in the documentation for running.
