Running Tests
============

To check the package is installed properly, try running the test. 

In the package, there is a tests directory. This directory contains an example
directory for how the input directory must be structured. Currently there is not
data in this directory. If there were, the test could be run as follows:

  > TestTopaz

This should run topaz on the files in the exampledir/foder directory, and output
the maps into exampledir/out1 and exampledir/out2.
