# Topaz: Very much work in progress

Topaz is a package that converts .phs data files for electron density into
.maps. This is done my calling functions from within CCP4 using CCP4Dispatchers.

The outputs of this are a set of .mtz files, a set of .maps of varying sizes and
a set of maps that are all the same specified dimensions. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project working on your local machine. 

### Prerequisites

To install this software you will need: 

It is important to have already installed ccp4, CCP4Dispatchers and iotbox
before running this program. 

### Installing

To get a development env running first download the package. Then go to the
directory containing setup.py and type the following into the command line. 

```
> module load ccp4
> ccp4-python setup.py develop --user
```

... (also not working...)

### How to use

The program is run by calling running from the command line. The program must be
called using CCP4python. The arguments
required are as follows:

* --out1: Location to save maps before tessalation
* --out2: Location to save maps after tessalation
* --folder1: Directory to find files with phasing and symmetry. (e.g. Ep\_phasing
  and 20171025)
* --xyzlim1: Dimensions for tessalated map
* --raw: Whether the data is only the heavy atom positions or not. 

Example of how to call, if the default is needed there is not need to specify
the argument:
```
> RunTopaz --out1=/DIRECTORY/ --out2=/DIRECTORY/ --folder=/DIRECTORY/

- currently not working...
```

### Running tests

To run the program the directories must have a certain setup, an example of this
set up is included in the exampledir directory under the tests directory. In
here is an example of the layout of directories that the program requires. 

At the moment there is no data in these directories. If there were, the test
could be run as follows: 

```
> TestTopaz 
```

This should run topaz on the files in the exampledir/folder directory, and
output the maps into exampledir/out1 and exampledir/out2

```
expected outcome here
```
